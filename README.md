# swarm_intelligence

The goal of this repo is to experiment with swarm intelligence algorithms, multi-agent decentralized communication, distributed computation and much more.


# Notes

### Stage 1:
In this step, my goal is to implement a task distribution system with information gathering. Assume I have 5 agents, all of whome have a random chance of finding a task. Once a task is found, the agent will broadcast the task to all other agents. The agents will then decide which agent is best suited to complete the task. The agent that is best suited to complete the task will then be assigned the task.
